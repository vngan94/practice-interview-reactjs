- Core Typescript:
- How to set up TypeScript? (x) >>>
    - Dùng vite để set up basic project (plain JS hoặc vs React)
- Javascript and TypeScript? >>>
    - TypeScript is Javascript syntax for types
    - TypeScript được translate to JS để run trên browser 
- Does Typescript improve our code (x) >>>
    - Yes
- How to define type? >>>
    - 
- Explicit vs implicit types ?
    - Explicit type: provide type 
    - implicit types: để typescript tự đoán
    - ⇒ recommend: Explicit type
- interface >>>

    - same: used to define object, can be extended
    - difference:
        - Use interface: for Implement OOP
        - **Use **`**type**` for unions, intersections, and complex type expressions.  
- What is union in typeScript? >>>
    - it's like OR operator ⇒ union together with different type
    - use it for parameter in a function
- What do you know type narrowing in TypeScript? >>>
    - purpose: help typescript figure out specific type by using condition 
- What is void in Typescript? Q1: What is void in Typescript? >>>
    - it means function returns nothing
- What is never in Typescript? >>>
    - it means function never comes to the end, the function throw an Error
- what is generic in typescript? >>>
    - purpose: deal with different types, it means you can pass any types
- What is the difference between tupple and array in Typescript? >>>
    - the number of elements:
        - array: dynamic
        - tuple: fixed, each element has specific type
- Q1: How to use optional properties in object? >>>
    - use question mark ? after the property, it means that the property is not optional
- Q2: How to use an elvis operator? >>>

    - purpose: avoid throw error when direct access sth null or undefined
- Q3: How to use double question mark ?? >>>
    - give the default value when direct access sth null or undefined
- How to type keys in object? >>>
    - Dùng key of
- What is index signature in Typescript? >>>
    - purpose: khi dynamic property name
- How to use Record helper in Typescript? >>>
    - thay cho index signature ⇒ more readable
    - purpose: define** s**pecific type for key and value of object   
- How to use Omit and Pick in Typescript? >>>
    - create new type từ interface hoặc type existing 
    - Omit: bỏ property
    - Pick: pick property
- How to use Readonly helper in Typescript? >>>
    - let property read only, dont want to change property of the object
- How to build a custom Readonly like Readonly helper in Typescript? >>>
    - .
        ```
        type ReadOnlyV2<T> = {
    readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P]
}
        ```
- How to use Partial helper in Typescript? >>>
    - Make all properties optional 
    - When you wrap an interface with `Partial`, **you no longer need to define all the properties** of that interface  
- What is required in Typescript? >>>

    - set up vs vite, chon tempate: React
    - type props, state
    - extenstion file: tsx
- Type reference >>>
    - chính là implicit type, typescript guess data type when we dont provide it
- literal type: >>>
    - **prupose: restrict a variable** to a specific value  
- What is tsconfig.json file? >>>
    - file config, cho biết Typescript sẽ check code ntn , compile code ntn
        - target - which Javascript version that code will be transformed from Typescript to Javascript
        - strict: true - enable typscript check type-
- What does Typescript as a language consists of? >>>
    - language - typescript: syntax, keyword, type annotation
    - compiler - Typescript Compiler: convert Typescript to Javascript
    - language service: statement completion, code format, color,..
- How to transpile file to Javascript? >>>
    - Dùng typescript compiler -tsc
- What is .d.ts in Typescript? >>>

- what is map file Typescript? >>>

- Advanced Typescript:
- What is function overloading in Typescript? >>>
    - to deal with different types or numbers of parameters and return type
    - prefer arrow function with union hơn
- what is extends? >>>
    - it's like if condition for typing
    - vs typeof:
        - typeOf: get the type of value, then compare
        - extends: compare type
